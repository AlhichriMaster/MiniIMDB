Creating a Netflix replica without servers can be a challenging task, but it's possible to create a simplified version with some basic functionalities. Here are the steps to create a local Netflix replica in Java without servers:

Step 1: Design the Data Model
Design the data model for the application. You can create a class for the movie, user, and the rating system. For example, the Movie class could have attributes like the movie name, genre, release year, and rating.

Step 2: Load Movie Data
Load the movie data into the application. You can store the movie data in a text file and load it into the application when it starts. You can use Java file handling to read the data from the text file and store it in the memory.

Step 3: Create a User Interface
Create a user interface for the application. You can use Java Swing or JavaFX to create a graphical user interface. The interface should allow users to browse the movie library, view movie details, and rate the movies.

Step 4: Implement the Rating System
Implement a rating system for the movies. You can allow users to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5. You can store the ratings in memory or in a text file.

Step 5: Create Movie Recommendations
Create movie recommendations for users based on their ratings. You can use a simple algorithm to recommend movies to users based on their ratings. For example, you can recommend movies that have the same genre or rating as the movies that the user has rated highly.

Step 6: Implement Search Functionality
Implement search functionality to allow users to search for movies based on the movie name or genre.

Step 7: Add Movie Trailers
Add movie trailers to the application. You can use YouTube APIs to display trailers for the movies.

Step 8: Implement Playback
Implement movie playback. You can use the Java media framework to play movies in the application.

Step 9: Testing
Test the application to ensure that it works as expected.

In conclusion, these are the basic steps to create a local Netflix replica in Java without servers. However, keep in mind that this is a simplified version of the original Netflix application and it may not have all the features of the original.
